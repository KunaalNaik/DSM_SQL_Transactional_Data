![Customer_Analysis_&_Sales_Performance_Analyys](5_dashboard/view_2.jpeg)

1. **Dominance of the USA:** The United States accounts for approximately half of the total orders and contributes to over 50% of the overall revenue, indicating its significant role in the company's sales.

2. **Significance of Classic Cars:** Classic cars play a vital role in the company's revenue, contributing to around 40% of the total revenue, with 20% of this revenue coming solely from the USA.

3. **Key Revenue-Generating Countries:** The majority, around 80%, of the total revenue is driven by just three countries: the USA, Spain, and France, emphasizing the importance of these markets for the company's profitability.

4. **Contribution of Specific Products:** Two product categories, classic cars (40%) and vintage cars (20%), collectively account for 60% of the total revenue, highlighting their crucial role in the company's sales.

5. **Best Performing Quarter and Month:** The fourth quarter emerges as the best performing quarter, generating 49% of the total revenue, with November alone contributing to 30% of the overall revenue, indicating a strong end-of-year performance.

6. **Underperforming Product Categories:** Trains and ships are the least performing product categories, contributing to only 2% of the total revenue. Among them, the USA, Spain, and Australia are the primary contributors, signaling potential areas for improvement or strategic adjustments.

7. **New Zealand's Low Revenue Impact:** Despite being among the top-performing countries, New Zealand generates relatively low-value orders, not contributing significantly to the company's overall revenue, suggesting a need for focused strategies to enhance its revenue contribution.

These observations provide valuable insights into the key drivers and challenges within the business, offering actionable points for strategic decision-making and operational improvements.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into customer behavior, market performance, and employee contributions, facilitating data-driven decision-making and strategic planning for the business.

Based on the comprehensive SQL analysis conducted on the provided dataset, notable insights have been revealed regarding customer behavior, market dynamics, and product performance within the ABC Company. The analysis has shed light on the dominant role of the USA in both order generation and revenue contribution, emphasizing the significance of targeted strategies to maintain and further capitalize on this market share. Furthermore, the prominent impact of classic cars on the company's revenue underscores the potential for leveraging this product category to drive sustained growth.

By recognizing the key revenue-generating countries, such as Spain and France, the company can prioritize tailored marketing and sales initiatives to strengthen its presence in these regions. Moreover, the identification of underperforming product categories, notably trains and ships, calls for focused interventions to revitalize their market performance. Lastly, the need to strategize market-specific approaches for countries like New Zealand, despite their relatively lower revenue impact, highlights the potential for targeted expansion and engagement strategies to tap into their market potential further.

These findings provide valuable direction for ABC Company to optimize its sales strategies, enhance customer engagement, and diversify its product offerings to foster sustainable business growth and performance. Further exploration and refinement of these insights can pave the way for more targeted and effective business strategies, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and heightened sales performance.
